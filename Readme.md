UML Sequence Diagram Description
Actors and Components:

Client/User Interface: The interface where users interact, typically a web browser.
Flask Web Application: Your Flask server, handling requests and responses.
Google Books API: The external API service providing book data.
Database: The database where notes are stored (for / route).
Flow for Search Functionality (/search Route):

User to Flask App:
The user inputs a search query in the UI and submits the request.
The Flask app receives the GET request with the search query.
Flask App to Google Books API:
The Flask app constructs a request with the search query and API key.
The request is sent to the Google Books API.
Google Books API to Flask App:
The API processes the request and sends back a response.
The response contains the book data in JSON format.
Flask App to User:
The Flask app processes the JSON data.
It then renders the search.html template with the book data and sends it to the user's browser.
Flow for Adding a Note (/ Route with POST Method):

User to Flask App:
The user submits a note via the UI.
The Flask app receives the POST request with the note data.
Flask App to Database:
The app creates a new Note object and saves it to the database.
Database to Flask App:
The database confirms the successful addition of the note.
Flask App to User:
The Flask app sends a success message and renders the home.html page with the updated notes.
Flow for Deleting a Note (/delete-note Route):

User to Flask App:
The user initiates a note deletion request.
The Flask app receives the POST request with the note ID.
Flask App to Database:
The app queries the database for the note and deletes it.
Database to Flask App:
The database confirms the note deletion.
Flask App to User:
The Flask app sends a JSON response indicating success or failure of the deletion process.
